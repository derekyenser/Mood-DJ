# Mood-DJ

**Objective**

Our Objective is to create a software to create custom playlist for a user. These playlist will be created by mood and using user prefrences.

After a mood(happy, sad, high energy, dance) or custom mood(valence, energy, danceability) is selected a playlsit will be generated for the user based on their preferences from our 230,000 song mySQL database.
