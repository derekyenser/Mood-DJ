Here is the Google Drive link to the executable for the python script: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1SaF43nm6onDJt3EEjSOrzeW4ueeVTyaK

Directions:
1. Use the link to download the zip file
2. Extract the folder to wherever the Java project is. You should still see the src and bin folders, dont navigiate further than that
3. If you have the RunPy class I uploaded to Github in your project, you should be able to copy paste the few lines of code in the
runPyTest to your code and hopefully everything works

NOTE: As of right now you wont see any changes in your database and the program might crash after gathering the songs from Spotify.This
is because the credentials for the databse are hardcoded into the program and are set to access the databse on my local computer.

ALSO, I will try to get the exe smaller so I can upload it directly to Github. Right now its at around 30MB and it needs to be smaller
than 25MB.
