Here is the Google Drive link to the executable for the python script: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vTSFUYQsoGjP10HA3Y1GpLzuzwPmIibA

Directions:
1. Use the link to download the zip file
2. Extract the folder to wherever the Java project is. You should still see the src and bin folders, dont navigiate further than that
3. If you have the RunPy class I uploaded to Github in your project, you should be able to copy paste the few lines of code in the
runPyTest to your code and hopefully everything works. For testing puroses I added a getDBCreds method to the RunPy class which allows you
to use the database on your computer. If you don't include that method the program will try to connect to the one on my pc which wont work
and the program will crash

ALSO, I will try to get the exe smaller so I can upload it directly to Github. Right now its at around 30MB and it needs to be smaller
than 25MB.
